# CollegeCodes
TBH During college, even though my professor told us students to put things on Github, at that time I didn't know any purpose of it aside of keeping copies of your code. \
Now that I relaized that collaborations are vital that's when I started using GitHub. \
Well this is just an archive. I want to recall what codes have I done in the past 5 years HAHAHAHA.\
Maybe try to fiz some unfinished ones in the future.
